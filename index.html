Histamine intolerance (HIT) happens when the body cannot break down histamine efficiently. The enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO) does most of this work. When DAO activity is low, histamine builds up and causes symptoms such as headaches, digestive issues, flushing, itching, or rapid heart rate.¹

Foods Most Likely to Cause Problems

The highest histamine levels are found in aged, fermented, and processed foods. These items naturally accumulate histamine over time, so avoiding them is often the most effective first step.²
Common triggers include:

Aged cheeses

Fermented sausages

Sauerkraut

Alcohol (especially red wine and champagne)

Leftover fish or seafood, or any fish that isn’t extremely fresh³

Fish is especially sensitive: once it warms above safe temperatures, bacteria convert histidine to histamine very quickly.³

Why Freshness Matters

Histamine forms when bacteria have time to grow. If food—especially fish, meat, or leftovers—is stored too long or too warm, histamine levels rise.

Fresh fish kept at 0–4°C stays safe.

Temperatures above 10°C lead to rapid histamine formation.³
This applies to meat as well: freshly prepared meat is typically tolerated, while aged, marinated, or processed meats are more likely to trigger symptoms.

Histamine-Releasing Foods

Some foods don’t contain much histamine but can cause the body to release its own.¹
Common examples:

Citrus fruits

Strawberries

Tomatoes

Spinach

Chocolate

Certain additives—including benzoates and sulfites—may also worsen symptoms by affecting DAO activity.⁴

Foods Usually Better Tolerated

For most people with HIT, the safest base diet is fresh and unprocessed.⁵
Often well-tolerated:

Freshly cooked meat and poultry

Most fresh vegetables (except known triggers like tomatoes, spinach, and eggplant)

Fresh dairy products

Grains (including gluten-containing grains)

Fresh herbs

Most cooking oils

Tolerance varies, but these foods provide a reliable starting point.

Storage and Preparation Guidelines

How you handle food is as important as what you eat.⁶
Core rules:

Refrigerate immediately after cooking or purchasing.

Freeze portions right away if not eating soon.

Consume leftovers within 24 hours.

Avoid reheating food multiple times—cooling/warming cycles allow bacteria to grow again.

These steps help keep histamine levels low even in foods you normally tolerate.

Individual Thresholds Matter

There is no single “safe amount” of histamine.⁷ Your tolerance changes depending on stress levels, hormones, alcohol intake, gut health, and medications. People with lower DAO activity react to smaller amounts, while others may tolerate more.

The practical approach:

Identify your personal triggers.

Keep meals simple and fresh.

Add foods back slowly to test tolerance.

Track symptoms and patterns.
